### Full Binary Tree 

* A tree in which all the nodes are filled completely. 

* number of nodes in the tree = 2^(height of tree) -1 ;


### Complete Binary Tree 

* A tree which will be filled completely. till the last leave nodes. and leave nodes will be filled from left to right 

* we can check if the sub tree are full binary tree and get the number of nodes in it by height , if we recursively add them . we get 
number of nodes in complete binary tree
