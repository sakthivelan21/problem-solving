# Trick 1

	* To make a circular iteration motion inside a list or string with index.

	* we can use modulo operator with the counter value to make the motion

		N- represent the total length of the array 

		index - represent the movement 

		ctr - represent the necessary jump to be made 

		arr[(index+ctr)%N]

		comes in handy to reduce code length and good code

# Trick 2

	* to convert the ascii value in integer type into character 

		char c=(char)86;
		int c=(int)'a';

# Trick 3
	
	* to print the string from the particular position to the end in c

		printf("%s",&string[startIndex]); where startIndex will be the index specified by us

# Trick 4

	* to concatenate two numbers in c

		a = pow(a,log(n)+1)+n 

# Trick 5 

	* to convert an array of numbers to a integer ( [1,2,3,4,5] to 12345)

		5+4*10 -> 45

		45+ 3*100 -> 345

		345 + 2*1000 -> 2345

		2345 + 1*10000 -> 12345

	* this way can save lot of rather than using tough approach
