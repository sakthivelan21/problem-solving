# problem-solving
This repos contains some problem solving questions and algorithms

### problem solving approach

1. Identify and Understand the nature of problem

	What is the problem 

	Understand the problem occurence

	Think all the alternatives test case  and issues related in problem

2. Research & Refine the problem

	Try to Research for the alternative approaches to that problem

	It helps to find many ways to approach the problem with other people code
