To make a circular iteration motion inside a list or string with index
we can use modulo operator with the counter value to make the motion

N- represent the total length of the array 
index - represent the movement 
ctr - represent the necessary jump to be made 

arr[(index+ctr)%N]

comes in handy to reduce code length and good code


to convert the ascii value in integer type into character 

char c=(char)86;
int c=(int)'a';
