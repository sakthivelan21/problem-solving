# problem-solving
This repo contains some problem solving questions and algorithms which can help i guess.

if you find any issues in my code feel free to raise a issue and i try to fix it !!!

## problem solving approach

1. Identify and Understand the nature of problem

	What is the problem 

	Understand the problem occurence

	Think all the alternatives test case  and issues related in problem

2. Research & Refine the problem

	Try to Research for the alternative approaches to that problem

	It helps to find many ways to approach the problem with other people code

3. Outline the logic to the problem as algorithm

	We have to figure the way how to get the logic in code by designing the algorithm for it
	
	Just design the flow of control logic for the algorithm 

4. Try to Write the Algorithm logic into code 

	Solve the problem by breaking the problem into small parts.
	
	Implement the small parts which can help you solve the code quicker as every small step will bring you the finish line.

5.  Test Driven Developement

	Try new test cases for the algorithm to make sure it work 
	
	If it fails , optimize the logic for the failure occurence
	
	Keep trying with new test cases
	
6. If you can't fix the problem 

	Take a break and relax yourself 
	
	Then try the problem to solve after some time 

7. Further Work

	Once your code works try to improve time , space complexity 
	
	you can add error handling , remove duplicate codes and improve readibility of your code.
